  A Streamlit app that extracts structured text from images using Google's Gemma 3 Vision model via Ollama.

  **NOTE:** Please be sure to run this app locally since Ollama is designed to run on your local machine or on a server you control. Please be sure to clone the code inside app.py to run the image OCR text extraction example.
